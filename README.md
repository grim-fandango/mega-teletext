# mega-teletext
A teletext screen driver for the MEGA 65

The idea with this program is to be able to present it with a teletext T42 file and it will display on the MEGA65 screen.  It uses Super-Extended Attribute Mode, which is rich enough to provide upper and lower case characters as well as the full spectrum of graphics and separated graphics glyphs.

This driver can be the enabler of teletext and viewdata application software for the MEGA65.

The source code is intended to be compiled using the Acme cross-assembler.
